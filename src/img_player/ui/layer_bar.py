"""LayerBar — custom-painted row showing one layer's range on the master timeline.

Visual model:

    │padding│··················· bar area ··················│padding│
    │       │ │┃────────── shotA.####.exr ─────────┃│       │
    │       │ ↑                                    ↑        │
    │     in handle              body          out handle   │
    │                                                       │
    │  master_first ───── playhead snap ─────── master_last │

Mouse interactions:

* Drag on the **body** → shifts ``layer.offset``.
* Drag on the **left handle** → adjusts ``layer.layer_in``.
* Drag on the **right handle** → adjusts ``layer.layer_out``.
* During the drag we show a live preview but commit only on
  release, so the LayerStack fires a single ``layer_modified``
  signal per gesture (one cache invalidation, not hundreds).

Snap targets (within ``SNAP_PX`` screen pixels):

* The master playhead.
* Master in / out points (when set).
* Every other layer's master_start / master_end edges.

The widget draws everything itself — there's no QSS — so the
visual stays consistent regardless of theme. Coordinate maths
live in pure helpers (testable without Qt event simulation).
