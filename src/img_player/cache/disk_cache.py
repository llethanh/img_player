"""On-disk frame cache tier — half-float lz4 blobs + SQLite LRU index.

Sits between :class:`MasterFrameCache` (RAM) and ``read_frame`` (source
decode + OCIO input prep) as a third tier. The goal: re-opening the
same shot tomorrow finds yesterday's frames warm without re-decoding
the EXRs.

Why these choices
-----------------

* **Half-float blobs** — frames are stored as ``float16`` rather than
  ``float32``. 2× smaller on disk; the dtype is restored to float32 on
  read (free) so consumers see no difference. Half-float covers HDR up
  to 65 504 with sub-percent precision in the 0..1 range — well beyond
  what a viewer needs to display.

* **lz4 compression** — fastest mainstream compressor (~3 GB/s decode
  on a modern CPU). A 4K float16 frame compresses to ~25 MB and
  decompresses in ~5 ms. Compared to a fresh EXR decode (~300 ms) this
  is a 50× win on slow sources. Falls back to zlib if ``lz4`` isn't
  importable — the cache still works, just slower.

* **SQLite for the index** — atomic, crash-safe (WAL mode),
  transactional bulk operations for LRU eviction. One column carries
  ``last_access`` (UNIX epoch) so trimming to budget is a single
  indexed query.

* **Async writes** — :meth:`put` enqueues to a dedicated writer
  thread; the caller never blocks on disk I/O. Useful when eviction
  happens during playback: the RAM is freed immediately, the blob
  lands a few hundred ms later.

* **Sharded blob layout** — ``<cache_dir>/<hash[:2]>/<hash[2:4]>/<hash>.bin``
  to avoid 100k files in a single directory (lethal on NTFS). Each
  blob's existence is the source of truth; SQLite is rebuilt-able by
  scanning the tree if it's ever lost.

Key contract
------------

Keys are opaque strings (callers compute them — typically a
SHA-1 of ``(canonical_path, mtime, channel_set, alpha_flags)``).
The cache doesn't interpret them; it just maps key → blob. This
keeps the cache decoupled from layer / session semantics.

Threading
---------

* :meth:`get` and :meth:`put` are thread-safe.
* :meth:`put` is fire-and-forget — actual disk write happens on the
  writer thread. The ndarray passed in **must not be mutated** by the
  caller after the call returns; the cache assumes the frame is
  immutable once cached (same contract as ``MasterFrameCache._frames``).
* SQLite access is serialised via a single connection + lock.
